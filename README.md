# Starter Config (for Murph)

## Install

0. Remove any custom stuff that you added to your `tf/cfg` folder (`medic.cfg`, `autoexec.cfg`, etc.)
1. [Download](https://github.com/rufio-tf2/starter-config/archive/for-murph.zip) this repo
1. Unzip it
1. If your folder structure is `starter-config-for-murph/starter-config-for-murph` save the inner folder and delete the outer folder
1. Move the remaining folder into your `tf/custom` folder
1. Use this config's `cfg` folder for future customizations (instead of `tf/cfg`): `tf/custom/starter-config-for-murph/cfg`
1. Inside of the `starter-config-for-murph` folder, you can delete the `README` file (it contains these instructions) and the `.gitignore` file. You can also just leave them. They barely take up any space and they don't do anything on your computer.
1. Feel free to rename the folder `starter-config-for-murph`.
